# Collapse of Paragon

## Overview

**Collapse of Paragon** is a retro, text-based fantasy adventure game built in Python. Set in a decaying empire on the brink of ruin, the game invites players to explore mysterious locations, interact with strange characters, solve logic puzzles, and make choices that shape the fate of the world.

This release contains **Level 1** of the game — a self-contained chapter that introduces the setting, mechanics, and tone of the broader story. Future levels will expand the narrative and introduce new gameplay elements.

## Features

- Rich, branching storyline with multiple endings
- Turn-based combat system
- Inventory management and item-based puzzles
- Logic and riddle-based encounters
- Modular design for easy expansion or modification
- Built entirely in Python, with no external dependencies

Game Structure
The game is divided into a series of scenes, each with unique challenges, branching choices, and consequences. Behind the scenes, each scene is implemented as a Python module or function, making the story easy to extend or modify.

Example Gameplay
